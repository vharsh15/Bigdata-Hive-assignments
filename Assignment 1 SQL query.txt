1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location

hdfs dfs -put /home/cloudera/harsh/sales_order_data.csv /harsh


3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

create table sales_order_csv
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH int,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE int,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE int,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
row format delimited  
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1"); 

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

load data inpath '/harsh/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_csv; 


5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

create table sales_order_orc
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH int,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE int,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE int,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
stored as orc;  




6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"

from sales_order_csv insert overwrite table sales_order_orc select *;




Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :


a. Calculate total sales per year ***************

SELECT YEAR_ID as SalesYear,Sum(SALES) AS TotalSales FROM sales_order_orc GROUP BY YEAR_ID  ORDER BY YEAR_ID;


b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed ***************

SELECT PRODUCTLINE,Sum(QUANTITYORDERED) as max_orders 
FROM sales_order_orc
GROUP BY PRODUCTLINE;


c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter ************

Select QTR_ID,Sum(SALES) AS TotalSales
FROM sales_order_orc GROUP BY QTR_ID;



d. In which quarter sales was minimum *************

select QTR_ID,min(SALES) as Min_sales_in_quater FROM sales_order_orc GROUP BY QTR_ID;



e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum *************   Not working properly .   



SELECT COUNTRY ,MIN(SALES) AS MIN_SALES,MAX(SALES) AS MAX_SALES FROM sales_order_orc GROUP BY COUNTRY ;

SELECT MIN(SALES) AS MIN_SALES,MAX(SALES) AS MAX_SALES FROM sales_order_orc;

SELECT COUNTRY,SALES FROM sales_order_orc HAVING SALES= (SELECT MAX(SALES) FROM sales_order_orc) ;



f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city **********

Select CITY,YEAR_ID,QTR_ID,SUM(SALES) AS Total_Sales FROM sales_order_orc GROUP BY CITY,YEAR_ID,QTR_ID order by YEAR_ID ;


h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold ***********

select YEAR_ID,Max(QUANTITYORDERED) from sales_order_orc group by YEAR_ID;
